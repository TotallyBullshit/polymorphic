# polymorphic
A polymorphic perl script which replicates itself.

This is not a virus or a worm. But it can be a basic for a perl virus. This perl script renames its sub names and variable names from generation to generation. It adds `.pl` to its new generation filename. It only generates a new copy of itself to another file.
